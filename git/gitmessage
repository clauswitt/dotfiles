# 1. Explain what and why, instead of how 
# 2. Limit the subject line to ~50 characters. If you need more, use the body.
# 3. Follow this pattern: If applied, this commit will [commit message]
# 4. Capitalize the subject line (To follow Githubâ€™s default behaviour)
# 5. 72-character wrapped longer description. This should answer:
#   * Why was this change necessary?
#   * How does it address the problem?
#   * Are there any side effects?
#
# Include a link to the ticket, if any.
