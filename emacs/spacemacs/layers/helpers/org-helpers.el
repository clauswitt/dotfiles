;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    org-helpers provide many methods to configure org-mode easily
;;  for the GTD way of organizing tasks.
;;
;;; Installation:
;;
;;    Just put org-helpers.el in a directory thatÂ´s in you load-path
;;  and `(require 'org-helpers)` in your `init.el`.
;;
;;     Afterwards you can use the org-helpers functions to configure
;;   your org-mode to your wishes.
;;
;;; Credits
;;
;;    Most code is based on the wonderful article from
;;  norang. (http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html)
;;  Many thanks to Bernt Hansen for a well-founded approach!
